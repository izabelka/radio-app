# Radio App

## For my [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/izabelka/100-days-of-code)


I created a simple radio widget for Netguru recruitment task a while ago. My javaScript skills were very poor that time and now I want to write it once again using React.js

**Demo:** (not available yet)

### To do:
1. [x] Import stations from json file
2. [x] Build component that displays all radio stations
3. [ ] Make selected radio station expand
4. [ ] Add real radio stations players
5. [ ] Publish to Github Pages
